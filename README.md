# FileSplitter
The program allows you to send large files by splitting them and combinig them back. 

The **"packer"** file splits the selected file in the directory into several files not exceeding 1 GB
  (new files appear in the folder where the shared file is located)
Then the separated files are sent in any way.
After receiving the file, using **"unpacker"** they are collected together
  (you need to move them in a separate folder and indicate the directory where they are located)
